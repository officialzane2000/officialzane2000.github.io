Zane 2000 is the project of &#332;tautahi-based musician, Jonty Oâ€™Connor. Zane 2000 aims to showcase music that communicates his futurist visions - with a heavy focus on genre bending electronic music. 
  2019 saw the release of Zane 2000's first EP 'Computer Rock'. Although in the early stages of his solo career, Zane 2000 has opened for LA goth legends Drab Majesty, and has had multiple features on prominent New Zealand media outlets (UTR, RNZ Music) and has had considerable success on New Zealand's student radio stations (#2 on the SRN top 10 and a #1 on RDU's top 10). 
O'Connor has also released music as 'The Midimaster'. Composing various forms of electronic music has been his long term focus in addition to being an active session drummer/percussionist, composer, and producer. <br><br>
